        <p class="about-title-font about-font-size">
        	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am a computer science major. Currently studying at California State University, Los Angeles. I have a deep enjoyment for acquiring new knowledge, but a greater enjoyment for applying that knowledge to create something. I hope to work for a software engineering company that will allow me to play with the latest technologies to find applications to improve people's lives.<br/><br/>
            
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This feels like I am filling out a dating profile. Well I am 5'10" and I like long walks on the beach. . . <br/>No, but really now. I am always looking for new interesting things to do or learn. Currently attending school and working hard at it as well as trying to find a paid internship in the software industry. (If you know someone hiring head over to contact page <a href="Contact">link</a>) I would say I am interesting though some might discribe me as a total weirdo in a "good" way, whatever that means. It is a lot harder to fill this out then I thought it would be. I'm kinda hoping you did not go past the first paragraph. If you got this far I would like to know your favorite Pokemon for now go to cantact page and tell me which one it is. I think in the future I will make a servelt for that and keep track of peoples favorite Pokemon that have made is this far. I think I'm going to start a new paragraph to make this seem WAY more interesting.<br/><br/>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well you made it this far, good for you. I don't really see why at this point you are just torturing yourself. If you have made it this far I hope to know your favorite Pokemon by now. The real question is what do I fill this paragraph with. I guess a little more about me. I spend a lot of time behind a computer. Example typing this page has been a relaxation from coding my web page as well as setting up the server, as this whole thing is running on java servlets. I would be lying if I said that wasn't fun, but it was  a little stressful too. As I am applying for internships and was tryign to get a new site up that would look appealing I have been working hard on this. Now you might be wondering if I am applying for internships why did I fill up my about page with nonsense except the first paragraph? It is simple, because it is fun. Also I'm hoping the people doing the hiring are too busy to read this whole thing, though if you are one of those prospective employers. . . I work hard!! I promise I do, but I also have a sense of humor. I felt this was the best place to show it. Well if you made it this far cheers I will probably add some link to something later, but for now I am getting back to work. Bye for now.
